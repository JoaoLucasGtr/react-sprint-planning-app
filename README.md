# Sprint Planning Web App

This is a simple project, created with the purpose of studying the PWA technology.

The app itself is hosted by Github Pages in this [link](https://joaolucasgtr.github.io/sprint-planning-app/).

## About

This app is focused in the process of estimating tasks. You can create projects, add tasks to it and set story points for each one.

All data will be stored in **localStorage**, so you can refresh or close the page without worries of losing your progress.

With a minimalistic design, you'll be able to explore all resources with ease.

Enjoy yourself.
